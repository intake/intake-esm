Here's a quick checklist in what to include:

- [ ] Include a detailed description of the bug or suggestion
- [ ] Output of `intake_esm.show_versions()`
- [ ] Minimal, self-contained copy-pastable example that generates the issue if possible. Please be concise with code posted. See guidelines below on how to provide a good bug report:

  - [Minimal Complete Verifiable Examples](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve)
  - [Craft Minimal Bug Reports](http://matthewrocklin.com/blog/work/2018/02/28/minimal-bug-reports)

    Bug reports that follow these guidelines are easier to diagnose,
    and so are often handled much more quickly.
