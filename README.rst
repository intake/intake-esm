Motivation
----------


Computer simulations of the Earthâ€™s climate and weather generate huge amounts of data.
These data are often persisted on HPC systems or in the cloud across multiple data
assets of a variety of formats (netCDF, `Zarr`_, etc...). Finding, investigating,
loading these data assets into compute-ready data containers costs time and effort.
The data user needs to know what data sets are available, the attributes describing
each data set, before loading a specific data set and analyzing it.

Finding, investigating, loading these assets into data array containers
such as xarray can be a daunting task due to the large number of files
a user may be interested in. Intake-esm aims to address these issues by
providing necessary functionality for searching, discovering, data access/loading.


Overview
--------

`intake-esm` is a data cataloging utility built on top of `intake`_, `pandas`_, and
`xarray`_, and it's pretty awesome!

- Opening an ESM collection definition file: An ESM (Earth System Model) collection file is a JSON file that conforms
  to the `ESM Collection Specification`_. When provided a link/path to an esm collection file, ``intake-esm`` establishes
  a link to a database (CSV file) that contains data assets locations and associated metadata
  (i.e., which experiement, model, the come from). The collection JSON file can be stored on a local filesystem
  or can be hosted on a remote server.

  .. code-block:: python

        >>> import intake
        >>> col_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NCAR/intake-esm-datastore/master/catalogs/pangeo-cmip6.json"
        >>> col = intake.open_esm_datastore(col_url)

- Search and Discovery: ``intake-esm`` provides functionality to execute queries against the database:

  .. code-block:: python

        >>> cat = col.search(experiment_id=['historical', 'ssp585'], table_id='Oyr',
        ...          variable_id='o2', grid_label='gn')

- Access: when the user is satisfied with the results of their query, they can ask ``intake-esm``
  to load data assets (netCDF/HDF files and/or Zarr stores) into xarray datasets:

  .. code-block:: python

        >>> dset_dict = cat.to_dataset_dict(zarr_kwargs={'consolidated': True, 'decode_times': False},
        ...                        cdf_kwargs={'chunks': {}, 'decode_times': False})
